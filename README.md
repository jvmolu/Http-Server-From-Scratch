[HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol) is the
protocol that powers the web. In this challenge, I have built a HTTP/1.1 server
that is capable of serving multiple clients concurrently via Multi-threading.

Server is also able to recieve/respond files from/to the client.

GZIP Encoding of the body is also supported.

This is a Java solution to the
["Build Your Own HTTP server" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/http-server/overview).
